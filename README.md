## MVP Roadmap
Following advice from a knowledgeable sage, for the time being this project is focused on achieving an MVP. That is
 to say that the aim is to achieve a basic level of functionality and a core set of features on which to build.

All planned features and known issues are held on the [NQP Issue Tracker].
