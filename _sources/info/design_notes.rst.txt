Design Notes
======================

Theming
---------------
The map's god is the centre of the theme for that level. The level style, aesthetic, layout and entities should all reflect the god. This does not count for entities not from that map.

Afflictions should be more mundane, earthly things, whereas blessings should reflect the god giving the blessing and reflect the god intervening in a small way, like the god is lending a small part of their power. They should also link to that gods' interventions.

To reflect the emphasis on gods being central to the theme, afflictions are the most common and least impactful, then blessings are slightly more powerful and rarer and finally a gods interventions are rarest and most powerful.
